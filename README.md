## concurrency-test
> A practice project to solve concurrency issues under high load and ensure data consistency and correct ordering.

## Description
> - A coffee event is held by `Starbucks` 
> - Users place coffee orders, and a rank from 1 to 100 is assigned based on the order time  
> - A maximum of 100 orders are allowed  
> - Each order reduces the coffee stock by 1  
> - Rewards are given based on the rank of the order  
> - Reward by rank:  
 >  - 1st: Gold Coffee  
  > - 2nd: Silver Coffee  
 >  - 3rd: Bronze Coffee  
 >  - 4th–10th: Wooden Coffee  
>   - 11th–100th: Regular Coffee  

## Branches
> - `main`: Basic setup without any concurrency control  
> - `lock/pessimistic`: Version with **Pessimistic Locking** applied  
> - `lock/optimistic`: Version with **Optimistic Locking** applied  
> - `isolation`: Version using **Transaction Isolation Levels** for concurrency control
